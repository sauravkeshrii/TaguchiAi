## 🌟 Vision
Engineering is often a battle against variance. **Taguchi.Ai** was built to give researchers, students, and industrial engineers a professional-grade "Minitab alternative" that lives in the browser. 

Whether you are optimizing a chemical reaction, tuning a 3D printer, or engineering aerospace components, Taguchi.Ai helps you find the **Robust Optimum** with the fewest possible experiments.

## 🚀 The Three-Step Workflow

### 1. 🏗️ Design Mode (The Planner)
Forget manual matrix lookups. Define your control factors, name your levels (e.g., 100°C, 200°C), and let the engine select the mathematically perfect **Orthogonal Array** ($L_4$, $L_9$, $L_{18}$, etc.).

*   **Result**: A professional **Hardware Map** (Experiment Plan) that you can export to Excel or print for the lab.

### 2. 🧪 Lab Execution
Take your exported plan to the workbench. Conduct your trials following the scientific roadmap provided. No guessing, no wasted resources—just targeted data collection.

### 3. 📊 Analysis Mode (The Oracle)
Paste your results directly into the dash. Taguchi.Ai instantly performs the complex math:
*   **S/N Ratio Analysis**: Measure robustness against noise.
*   **ANOVA Decomposition**: See which factor truly "moves the needle."
*   **Optimal Prediction**: Get the exact "Secret Recipe" for your product's peak performance.
